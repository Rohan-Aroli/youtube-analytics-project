📊 YouTube Data Analytics & Insights Project

A complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on real-world YouTube creator data.
This project uncovers trends across subscribers, categories, earnings, demographics, upload patterns, and global creator distribution using Python-based data analytics and visualization techniques.

🔍 Overview

This project analyzes multiple aspects of YouTube creators, including:

Top creators by subscribers and views

Category-level trends (uploads, earnings, popularity)

Country-wise creator distribution

Correlation between subscribers, uploads, views, earnings, and demographic factors

Outlier detection using IQR

Channel creation trends by year, month, and season

Geographic insights using latitude & longitude

Earnings (monthly & yearly) patterns

The goal is to transform a raw dataset into actionable insights using Python’s analytics ecosystem.
